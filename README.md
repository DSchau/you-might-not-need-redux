## Contributing Back

Feel free, contributions of any variety welcome.

### Getting Started

I recommend using `yarn` but `npm` will work just as well.

- `yarn start`
  Launch a local development server, hot reloading any changes to content
- `yarn build`
  Build static assets; this command will generally be run by CI (Netlify), but it can be helpful for testing/debugging
